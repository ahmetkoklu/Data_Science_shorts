# Data_Science_shorts
Short Data Science Practice Projects for beginners. Datasets are obtained from various sources like; DataCamp, Coursera, Kaggle, etc.
All of those are projects that I completed during early stages of my training. Some of those were guided, describing what to do 
and drawing some boundaries about the libraries to be used. Some of them were unguided that means they only check the result, with no boundaries.

I really enjoyed wrangling with those datasets, some of them are extremely interesting. Also I believe they would be helpfull to get familiar with some basic concepts.
They include basic implemetation of Python and SQL languages as well as some elementary concepts about some major libraries like; Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, etc. 

Not everyone has access to these MOOC's most of those request paid membership, so I decided to share this small projects to support beginners.
I hope it helps. Please feel free to contact for any questions.

Enjoy,
